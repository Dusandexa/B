                The European Commission has granted conditional approval for the proposed merger between TeleNova Group and 
                Eurolink Communications, two of the largest telecommunications providers in Southeast Europe.
              </p>

              <p>
                BnB Law represented TeleNova Group throughout the complex regulatory approval process, which spanned 18 months.
              </p>

              <h2>Key Conditions Imposed</h2>
              <p>
                The approval comes with several structural remedies designed to preserve competitive market conditions. The merged 
                entity must divest its mobile spectrum holdings in two markets and provide wholesale access to its fiber network 
                for a period of ten years on regulated terms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Additionally, the Commission required commitments regarding pricing transparency and non-discrimination in 
                wholesale agreements with competing operators — conditions that reflect growing regulatory scrutiny of vertical 
                integration in telecommunications markets.
              </p>

              <h2>Implications for the Industry</h2>
              <p>
                This decision establishes important precedent for future cross-border telecom transactions in the region. The 
                Commission's approach signals a willingness to approve consolidation where parties demonstrate genuine efficiency 
                gains and commit to meaningful behavioral remedies.
              </p>

              <h2>Next Steps</h2>
              <p>
                The parties now have 90 days to implement the required divestitures. Our team continues to advise TeleNova on 
                the execution of these commitments and the broader integration planning process.
